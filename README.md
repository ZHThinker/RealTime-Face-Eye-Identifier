# 🤖 Real-Time-Face-Eye-Identifier
## 📖 Overview


A high-performance Computer Vision application built with Python and OpenCV. This project goes beyond simple face detection by providing a stylized, high-tech interface for tracking subjects and identifying specific facial features in real-time.

## 🌟 Key Features
-  ***Intelligent Face Detection:*** Uses optimized Haar Cascade classifiers to identify faces with high precision.

-  ***Feature-Level Tracking:*** Nested detection logic to identify and track eyes within the face region.

-  ***Dynamic Identity Labeling:*** Real-time text overlay for subject names and confidence scoring.

-  ***High-Tech HUD:*** A stylized "Heads-Up Display" (HUD) interface inspired by advanced surveillance and cinematic tech.
